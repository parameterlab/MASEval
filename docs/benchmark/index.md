# Benchmarks

MASEval includes pre-implemented benchmarks for evaluating multi-agent systems.

## Adding Custom Benchmarks

You can also create your own benchmarks by subclassing the [`Benchmark`](../reference/benchmark.md) class. See the [Five-a-Day example](../examples/five_a_day_benchmark.ipynb) for a complete walkthrough.

## Licensing

For detailed source and licensing information for each benchmark's data, see [BENCHMARKS.md](https://github.com/parameterlab/MASEval/blob/main/BENCHMARKS.md).
