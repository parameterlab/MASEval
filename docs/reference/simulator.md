# Simulators

Simulators in MASEval are used to create reproducible and scalable testing environments for multi-agent systems. Their primary function is to mock the behavior of external dependencies such as APIs, databases, or human users. By using simulators, developers can test agent interactions in a controlled, isolated environment. This approach eliminates variability from external factors like network latency or API availability, ensuring that benchmark results are consistent and deterministic. This allows for a more precise evaluation of agent performance and reliable comparison between different implementations.
