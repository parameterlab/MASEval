class TaskExecutionStatus(Enum):
    """Status of task execution and evaluation.

    This enum tracks the execution state of a task through the benchmark lifecycle,
    enabling graceful failure handling and comprehensive result reporting.

    The status distinguishes between errors caused by the agent (agent's fault) and
    errors caused by the evaluation infrastructure (environment, user simulator).
    This enables fair scoring by excluding infrastructure failures.

    Attributes:
        SUCCESS: Task executed and evaluated successfully.
        AGENT_ERROR: Agent violated contract at a boundary (agent's fault, counts against score).
        ENVIRONMENT_ERROR: Environment/tool infrastructure failed (not agent's fault, exclude from scoring).
        USER_ERROR: User simulator failed (not agent's fault, exclude from scoring).
        TASK_TIMEOUT: Task execution exceeded configured timeout (resource constraint).
        UNKNOWN_EXECUTION_ERROR: Unclassified execution error (e.g., agent framework internal failure).
        EVALUATION_FAILED: Task executed but evaluation raised an exception.
        SETUP_FAILED: Setup phase (environment, agents, evaluators) raised an exception.

    Scoring Guidance:
        - Include in agent score: SUCCESS, AGENT_ERROR
        - Exclude from agent score: ENVIRONMENT_ERROR, USER_ERROR, TASK_TIMEOUT, UNKNOWN_EXECUTION_ERROR
        - Handle separately: EVALUATION_FAILED, SETUP_FAILED

class Benchmark(ABC):
    """Abstract base class for orchestrating multi-agent system execution and evaluation.

    Benchmark provides a structured framework for running reproducible agent experiments across
    a collection of tasks. It manages the complete execution lifecycle: environment initialization,
    agent instantiation, task execution, and performance evaluation. The class enforces a
    three-stage pattern (setup, run, evaluate) while handling task iteration, callback orchestration,
    message history collection, and result aggregation.

    How to use:
        1. **Subclass Benchmark** and implement the abstract methods to define your benchmark logic
        2. **Implement setup methods** to specify how environments, agents, and evaluators are created
        3. **Implement run_agents** to define how your multi-agent system solves a single task
        4. **Instantiate your benchmark** with agent configuration
        5. **Call benchmark.run(tasks)** to execute the complete benchmark

        Example workflow:
            ```python
            class MyBenchmark(Benchmark):
                def setup_environment(self, agent_data, task):
                    return MyEnvironment(task.environment_data)

                def setup_agents(self, agent_data, environment, task, user):
                    agent = MyAgent(model=agent_data["model"])
                    agent_adapter = AgentAdapter(agent, "agent")
                    return [agent_adapter], {"agent": agent_adapter}

                def run_agents(self, agents, task, environment, query):
                    return agents[0].run(query)

                # ... implement other abstract methods

            # Run the benchmark
            config = {"model": "gpt-4", "temperature": 0.7}
            benchmark = MyBenchmark()
            reports = benchmark.run(tasks=my_tasks, agent_data=config)

            # Retry failed tasks elegantly (graceful task failure handling by default)
            failed_tasks = benchmark.get_failed_tasks()
            if len(failed_tasks) > 0:
                retry_reports = benchmark.run(tasks=failed_tasks, agent_data=config)

            # Parallel execution for I/O-bound workloads
            benchmark = MyBenchmark(max_workers=4)
            reports = benchmark.run(tasks=my_tasks, agent_data=config)

            # Or use strict mode for debugging (fail fast)
            benchmark = MyBenchmark(
                fail_on_task_error=True,
                fail_on_evaluation_error=True,

            )
            reports = benchmark.run(tasks=my_tasks, agent_data=config)
            ```

        The framework handles task iteration, repetitions for statistical robustness, callback
        notifications, and result collection. You focus on defining agent behavior and evaluation
        criteria for your specific domain.

            callbacks: Optional list of callback handlers for monitoring execution, tracing messages,
                or collecting custom metrics during the benchmark run.
            n_task_repeats: Number of times to repeat each task. Useful for measuring variance in
                stochastic agent behaviors. Must be at least 1.
            max_invocations: Maximum number of agent invocations per task in the execution loop.
                For simple benchmarks, the default (1) means agents run once per task. For interactive
                benchmarks with user feedback loops, set higher (e.g., 5 for MACS) to allow multiple
                agent-user interaction rounds.
            max_workers: Maximum number of parallel task executions. Default 1 (sequential).
                Set higher for I/O-bound workloads (e.g., LLM API calls). This controls the
                ThreadPoolExecutor worker count for concurrent task processing.
            fail_on_setup_error: If True, raise exceptions when setup fails (environment, agents, evaluators).
                If False (default), catch exceptions during setup and record them in the report with status
                SETUP_FAILED. This allows the benchmark to continue running remaining tasks even if setup fails.
            fail_on_task_error: If True, raise exceptions when task execution fails. If False (default),
                catch exceptions during task execution and record them in the report with status
                TASK_EXECUTION_FAILED. This allows the benchmark to continue running remaining tasks.

                catch exceptions during evaluation and record them in the report with status
                EVALUATION_FAILED. This allows the benchmark to continue even if evaluation logic has errors.
            progress_bar: Controls progress bar during benchmark runs. When enabled, one of the
                ProgressBarCallback will be added. Options:
                - True (default): Automatically adds a TqdmProgressBarCallback if no ProgressBarCallback
                  is already present in the `callbacks` argument.
                - False: Does not automatically add a progress bar callback. Manually provided
                  ProgressBarCallback instances in the callbacks list will still work normally.
                - "tqdm": Automatically adds a TqdmProgressBarCallback (same as True)
                - "rich": Automatically adds a RichProgressBarCallback (uses the rich library)

    ) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Initialize and execute the complete benchmark loop across all tasks.

        Args:
            tasks: Task source for execution. Can be:
                - A single Task object
                - A BaseTaskQueue (SequentialTaskQueue, PriorityTaskQueue, or custom AdaptiveTaskQueue)
                - An iterable of Task objects or dicts that will be converted to Tasks

                When a BaseTaskQueue is provided, it controls the task ordering. AdaptiveTaskQueue
                subclasses are automatically registered as callbacks to receive task completion
                notifications.
            agent_data: Configuration for agents. Either a single dict applied to all tasks, or
                an iterable of dicts with one configuration per task. Agent data typically includes
                model parameters, agent architecture details, and tool specifications.

        Returns:
            List of report dictionaries, one per task repetition. Each report contains:
            - task_id: Task identifier (UUID)
            - repeat_idx: Repetition index (0 to n_task_repeats-1)
            - status: Execution status (one of TaskExecutionStatus enum values)
            - traces: Execution traces from all registered components
            - config: Configuration from all registered components and benchmark level
            - eval: Evaluation results (None if task or evaluation failed)
            - error: Error details dict (only present if status is not SUCCESS), containing:
                - error_type: Exception class name
                - error_message: Exception message
                - traceback: Full traceback string

        Raises:
            ValueError: If agent_data length doesn't match number of tasks (when agent_data is an iterable).

        How to use:
            This is the framework's main orchestration method that runs your entire benchmark. It
            iterates through all tasks, handles repetitions, and manages the three-stage lifecycle
            for each execution. You don't implement this method—instead, you call it to start the
            benchmark after implementing the setup and execution methods.

            By default, the benchmark will continue executing remaining tasks even if some fail.
            You can change this behavior by setting `fail_on_task_error=True`,
            `fail_on_evaluation_error=True`, or `fail_on_setup_error=True` when instantiating
            the benchmark. Each task execution returns a status indicating success or the specific
            failure type (see [`TaskExecutionStatus`][maseval.core.benchmark.TaskExecutionStatus]).

            For each task execution, the framework:

            1. Calls your setup methods to initialize components
            2. Calls your `run_agents()` method to execute the task
            3. Collects message histories and calls evaluators
            4. Stores results and triggers callbacks

            Pseudocode structure:
                ```
                for task in tasks:
                    for repeat in range(n_task_repeats):
                        # Setup stage
                        environment = setup_environment(agent_data, task)
                        user = setup_user(agent_data, environment, task)
                        agents_to_run, agents_dict = setup_agents(agent_data, environment, task, user)
                        evaluators = setup_evaluators(environment, task, agents_to_run, user)

                        # Run stage (execution_loop handles multi-turn if user exists)
                        agents_output = execution_loop(agents_to_run, task, environment, user)

                        # Evaluate stage
                        traces = collect_message_histories(agents_dict)
                        eval_results = evaluate(evaluators, traces, agents_dict)

                        # Store results
                        store_result(task_id, traces, eval_results)
                ```

            Callback hooks are triggered at these points:

            - on_run_start: Before processing any tasks
            - on_task_start: Before processing a task (once per task, not per repeat)
            - on_task_repeat_start: Before each repetition of a task
            - on_task_repeat_end: After each repetition completes
            - on_task_end: After all repetitions of a task complete
            - on_run_end: After all tasks complete
