## Known Issues in MARBLE

1. **Missing method**: `AgentGraph.get_agent_profiles_linked()` does not exist but is
   called in `engine.py:702`. This breaks chain coordination mode.

2. **SharedMemory naming**: Despite the name, `SharedMemory` is instantiated per-agent
   in `BaseAgent.__init__()` and is NOT shared between agents. Use `msg_box` for
   inter-agent communication.

3. **Environment constructor signature**: Some environments expect different constructor
   arguments. Check each environment's `__init__` signature before use.

## Local Patches Applied

None currently. Document any patches here if applied.

## Update Process

To update MARBLE to a newer version:

1. `cd maseval/benchmark/multiagentbench/marble`
2. `git fetch origin`
3. `git log --oneline origin/main` (review changes)
4. `git checkout <new-commit-hash>`
5. Run integration tests
6. Update this file with new version info
